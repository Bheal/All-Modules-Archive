# SISBID 2016 Module 2: Visualization of Biomedical Big Data

Instructors: Dianne Cook and Heike Hofmann

Module description: In this module, we will present general-purpose techniques for visualizing any sort of large data sets, 
as well as specific techniques for visualizing common types of biological data sets. Often the challenge of visualizing Big Data 
is to aggregate it down to a suitable level. Understanding Big Data involves an iterative cycle of visualization and modeling. 
We will illustrate this with several case studies during the workshop. The first segment of this module will focus on structured 
development of graphics using static graphics. This will use the ggplot2 package in R. It enables building plots using 
grammatically defined elements, and producing templates for use with multiple data sets. We will show how to extend these 
principles for genomic data using the ggplot2-based ggbio package. The second segment will focus on interactive graphics 
for rapid exploration of Big Data. We will also demonstrate interactive techniques using plotly, animint and ggvis. In addition 
we will explain how to create simple web GUIs for managing complex summaries of biological data using the shiny package. 
We will use a hands-on teaching methodology that combines short lectures with longer practice sessions. As students learn about 
new techniques, they will also be able to put them into practice and receive feedback from experts. We will teach using R and Rstudio. 
We will assume some familiarity with R.
