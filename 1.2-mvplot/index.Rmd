## Your turn

- What is multivariate data?
- What makes multivariate analysis different from univariate analysis?

## Main types of plots

- pairwise plots: explore replicates, and associations
- porcupine plots: to explore treatments vs replicates
- parallel coordinate plots: explore high-dimensional relationships with parallel axes
- tours: explore high-dimensional relationships with movies of projections

## GGally

Classical scatterplot matrix (draftman's) plot. All variables are numeric, show all possible pairs.


```{r}
data(flea)
ggscatmat(flea, columns = 2:4, color = "species") 
```

##

Generalized pairs plot, any combination of tpes of plots

```{r fig.width=6}
data(tips, package = "reshape")
ggpairs(tips[, 1:4])
```

## For biological data

Brown, A. and Hudson, K. (2015) Developmental profiling of gene expression in soybean trifoliate leaves and cotyledons, [GSE61857](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE61857). 

```{r eval=FALSE}
coty <- read_delim("data/GSE61857_Cotyledon_normalized.txt.gz",
  delim="\t", col_types="cddddddddd", 
  col_names=c("ID", "C_S1_R1", "C_S1_R2", "C_S1_R3", 
  "C_S2_R1", "C_S2_R2", "C_S2_R3", "C_S3_R1", "C_S3_R2", "C_S3_R2"),
  skip=1)
coty <- as.data.frame(coty)
ggscatmat(coty, columns=2:7, alpha=0.1)
```

Normalized data for the first 6 samples are shown.

##

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
coty <- read_delim("../data/GSE61857_Cotyledon_normalized.txt.gz",
  delim="\t", col_types="cddddddddd", 
  col_names=c("ID", "C_S1_R1", "C_S1_R2", "C_S1_R3", 
  "C_S2_R1", "C_S2_R2", "C_S2_R3", "C_S3_R1", "C_S3_R2", "C_S3_R3"),
  skip=1)
coty <- as.data.frame(coty)
ggscatmat(coty[sample(1:nrow(coty), 5000),], columns=2:7, alpha=0.1)
```

## What we learn

- The replicates look more like each other than the developmental stage 1 vs 2. This is great data!
- There is a lot of variability in counts across stages, would indicate a lot of gene activity. 
- There are a few genes that have some difference from one rep to another. These could be problematic when it comes to testing. To identify these it is easier to use interactive graphics - stay tuned for this tomorrow.

## Your turn

- Read the leaf data in from Brown and Hudson, and make a scatterplot matrix. (If it is too slow on your computer, sample the number of rows, to get a glimpse of the data to start.)
- Summarise what you learn about the data in a couple of sentences

## Porcupine plots

Compare treatment vs reps. Focus on reps 1, 2 from stages 1 and 2. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
sub <- coty %>% select(ID, C_S1_R1, C_S1_R2, C_S2_R1, C_S2_R2)
ggplot(sub, aes(x=C_S1_R1, xend=C_S1_R2, y=C_S2_R1, yend=C_S2_R2)) +
  geom_segment() + 
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

##

```{r echo=FALSE}
sub <- coty %>% select(ID, C_S1_R1, C_S1_R2, C_S2_R1, C_S2_R2)
ggplot(sub, aes(x=C_S1_R1, xend=C_S1_R2, y=C_S2_R1, yend=C_S2_R2)) +
  geom_segment() + xlim(c(0, 17.5)) + ylim(c(0, 17.5)) +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

The best prospects should be shortest lines further from the `X=Y`. 

## Your turn

Make a porcupine plot for the first two reps of the first two developmental stages of the leaf data.

## Parallel coordinate plots 

- Parallel coordinate plots, use parallel axes, and each observation is represented by a line tracing through the axes.
- They are useful for getting a sense of the multivariate shape of the data. You can typically read association, clustering and outliers from the plot. 
- Can handle more variables than scatterplot matrices.

## Side-by-side boxplots to par coords

```{r}
ggparcoord(coty, columns=2:10, scale="globalminmax", boxplot=TRUE,
           alphaLines=0)
```

If the data is normalised well these should be identical boxplots, or very close to that. This is not quite what we see. 

## Parallel coordinates, connect the dots


```{r eval=F}
ggparcoord(coty, columns=2:10, scale="globalminmax", 
           alphaLines=0.1)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggparcoord(coty[sample(1:nrow(coty), 1000),], 
           columns=2:10, scale="globalminmax", 
           alphaLines=0.1)
```

## Scaling choices

- *std*: univariately, subtract mean and divide by standard deviation
- *robust*: univariately, subtract median and divide by median absolute deviation
- *uniminmax*: univariately, scale so the minimum of the variable is zero, and the maximum is one
- *globalminmax*: no scaling is done; the range of the graphs is defined by the global minimum and the global maximum

## Your turn

- Make parallel coordinate plots for the 9 samples of the leaf data
- Start with side-by-side boxplots, and then generate the lines
- Run the different scaling options to discover how they change the appearance of the plto

## Parcoords to interaction plots

Experiments are often displayed using interaction plots. These are similar to parallel coordinates, which display all the measurements, but interaction plots show one gene at a time.

##

Process the data, and then plot

```{r}
sub <- coty[sample(1:nrow(coty), 6),] %>% 
  gather(sample, expr, -ID) %>%
  separate(sample, c("tissue", "stage", "rep")) %>%
  mutate(stage = as.numeric(substr(stage, 2, 2)))
sub.m <- sub %>% group_by(ID, stage) %>% 
  summarise(expr = mean(expr))
```

##


```{r}
ggplot(sub, aes(x=stage, y=expr)) + geom_point(alpha=0.4) +
  facet_wrap(~ID, ncol=3) + 
  geom_line(data=sub.m, aes(x=stage, y=expr), colour="red")
```

## Your turn

Re-make the previous plot, by overlaying them in one plot, instead of faceting, and colour by the ID.
